# TomcatSecurityAudit
PowerShell scripts designed to audit the security of Apache Tomcat configurations, focusing on password storage and compliance with NIST 800-53 IA-5 and CIS Tomcat Benchmark 4.1. The scripts identify insecure configurations, such as plaintext passwords or weak hashing, and provide recommendations to ensure a secure Tomcat environment.
